# photoMarker

A simple bash script that reduces the size of a photo and adds a watermark 
using Imagemagick's convert.

Online photo repositories such as Flickr and Picasa allow for the quick 
spread of pictures. Even if this is of great interest for many amateur and
professional photogtaphers, they would usually like to be recognised as 
the authors of a given picture. 

This simple sctipt performs two operations on a (set of) pictures:
(i) Reduces it's size by 50%
(ii) Writes a discrete watermark at the bottom of thr image.

CAUTION: this script overwrites the input file(s). Be sure to keep the 
a copy of the original file in a different, safe, place
